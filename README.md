#### Description:
Auction House is an auction website where users can view, list and bid on auction listings. Users are able to register an account, log in and create a new listing by filling out the create new listing form. They are also able to view available listings, add/remove listings to their watchlist, bid on listings and add comments.

#### Frontend:
The frontend of the website uses HTML, CSS and Bootrap.

#### Backend:
The back end is built in Python and Django. SQLite was used as the database and then updgraded to PostgreSQL for deployment. 

#### Highlights:

Django includes a default object-relational mapping layer (ORM) that can be used to interact with data from relational databases such as SQLite. 
This allows you to interact with information from your database as a Python object. This project focused on getting to grips with Django's built in ORM and ustilised it to create a dynamic web application with relationships across various models. In particular, model raltionships have been used in this projcet to associate Users, Auctions, Bids etc. The project utilises all three of the relationships supported by relational database systems: One to many, many to many and one to one. 

#### Web Hosting:

The application is hosted on Heroku. Heroku allows you to host web applications and has additional functionality such as postgress intergration.
